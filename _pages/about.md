Welcome to my personal homepage! My name is Gaoyuan Liu. I am currently a Master's student in Optimization and Control at the School of Math, Shanghai University of Finance and Economics. I am expected to graduate in the summer of 2025, advised by Prof. Yanjun Wang.

During my master's studies, I was a visiting student at Purdue University, advised by Dr. Zhe (Jimmy) Zhang. My research interests lie in stochastic optimization theory and the development of efficient first-order algorithms. I am currently seeking Ph.D. opportunities for the Spring/Fall 2026 intake.
