Welcome to my personal homepage! My name is Gaoyuan Liu. I am currently a Master's student in Optimization and Control at the School of Math, Shanghai University of Finance and Economics. I am expected to graduate in the summer of 2025, advised by Prof. Yanjun Wang.

My research focuses on stochastic optimization theory and the design and analysis of efficient optimization algorithms, with a special emphasis on first-order methods. I am passionate about developing both the foundational theory and practical methods to tackle large-scale and complex optimization problems. Before my time at SUFE, I had the valuable opportunity to be a visiting student at the School of Industrial Engineering at Purdue University, where I was supervised by Dr. Zhe Zhang.
